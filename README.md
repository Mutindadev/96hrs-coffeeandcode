# ☕ 96-Hour Coffee & Code: Python Learning Challenge

Welcome to my Python learning repository!  
This project is part of my *self-paced "96-Hour Coffee & Code Challenge"*, where I’m dedicating focused time to master Python by learning, practicing, and applying concepts through real code. Each file here is a reflection of the lessons I’ve studied and implemented — it’s my growing digital notebook and sandbox for all things Python.

The goal is simple: *Learn by doing. Code with clarity. Build a personal library of reusable, beginner-friendly Python resources* that I can use for future projects or freelance tasks.

## 🚀 What This Repo Is About

This repository contains:
- Python scripts I’ve written while learning the language
- Exercises and logic challenges based on lessons I’ve completed
- Reusable code that will be helpful in future software projects

I’ve created this space as a central place to *practice, **experiment, and **document* my growth as a Python developer. It’s also beginner-friendly, with most files written clearly and with comments for easy understanding.

## 📁 File & Script Overview

Here’s a breakdown of the current scripts in the repository and what they focus on:

| File | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| arrys.py | Simple array implementation and operations |
| arithmetic_operator.py | Basic arithmetic operators in Python: +, -, *, /, %, etc. |
| data_type.py | Understanding Python's data types: integers, strings, floats, booleans |
| exercise.py | Coding practice from my early lessons — variables, logic, syntax |
| exercise_2.py | Continuation of exercises for more complex logic building |
| input_fuction.py | Practice using input() and handling user data from the console |
| linkedlist.py | Basic introduction to linked lists for understanding data structures |
| series.py | Generating and manipulating number series and sequences |
| String_manupulation.py | Playing with string slicing, formatting, and text operations |
| swap_numbers.py | Swapping values between two variables without a third |
| type_casting.py | Converting between different types like string to int, int to float |
| var_in_python.py | Declaring, assigning, and understanding variables in Python |
| Lesson | A file where I keep additional raw lesson notes and guidance |

> Each script is standalone and can be opened independently for review, editing, or execution.

## 🌱 Why I Created This

This repo exists to:

* Reinforce everything I’m learning in Python through direct code
* Keep all my lessons, exercises, and experiments in one organized place
* Serve as a launchpad for future freelance and project work
* Make it easier to revisit, reuse, or expand any concept I’ve studied

It’s my way of combining *discipline + curiosity + creativity* while becoming a better developer.

## 💬 Notes for Fellow Beginners

If you’re learning Python like I am:

* Start with the basic files like var_in_python.py or arithmetic_operator.py
* Explore string manipulations and data types
* Try modifying the code to see how it behaves — learning comes faster that way
* I’ve added comments wherever possible to guide you through

More structure and notes will be added as I grow and revisit each topic.

## 🔭 Future Improvements

I plan to:

* Organize code into folders: basics/, functions/, oop/, data_structures/, etc.
* Add more mini-projects and real-world applications
* Document each folder with a README that explains what’s inside
* Include problem-solving scripts from platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank
